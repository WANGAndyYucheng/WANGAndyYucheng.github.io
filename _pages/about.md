## About me
Welcome! I'm a first-year Ph.D. student supervised by [Prof. Dan Xu](https://www.danxurgb.net), at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology ([HKUST]((https://hkust.edu.hk/))). I earned my Bachelor's degree also from [HKUST]((https://hkust.edu.hk/)).

My research centers on **human-centric generation** within the broader domain of computer vision and generative AI. Specifically, I am interested in talking head generation based on DiT/3DGS and pesonalized image generation. Feel free to connect!
