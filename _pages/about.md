## About me
Nice to meet you! I'm a first-year Ph.D. student at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology ([HKUST]((https://hkust.edu.hk/))) supervised by [Prof. Dan Xu](https://www.danxurgb.net) . 

I received my Bachelor's degree with double major also from [HKUST]((https://hkust.edu.hk/)) in 2024.

My current research interest lies in **Human-centric generation**, especially for Talking Head Video/3D Facial Animation generation with Diffusion Model. 

Welcome to any types of research collaboration and discussions!
