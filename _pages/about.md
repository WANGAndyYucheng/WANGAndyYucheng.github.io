## About me

I'm a second-year Ph.D. student advised by [Prof. Dan Xu](https://www.danxurgb.net) at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology ([HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk/)). I earned my bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Electronic Engineering from HKUST. I also spent a semester on exchange at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), where I was fortunate to work with [Dr. Danda Paudel](https://insait.ai/dr-danda-paudel/) on 3D gaze estimation and eye modeling.

My research centers on human-centric computer vision within the broader domain of computer vision and generative AI. Specifically, I am interested in **human-centric reconstruction** and **controllable image/video editing**. Feel free to connect!
